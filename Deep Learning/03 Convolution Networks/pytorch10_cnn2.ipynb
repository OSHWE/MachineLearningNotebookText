    "# Classification with CNNs and the CIFAR10 Dataset\n",
    "We will now apply convolution and pooling layers combined with fully connected layers to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset. CIFAR10 contains images in the RGB space that have dimensions of 32x32 pixels. Each image falls into 1 of 10 classes: planes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships and trucks. There are 6000 images in each class for a total of 60,000 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researching model architecture, I found an example in the Keras documentation that uses 4 `Conv2d` layers, 4 `MaxPool2d` layers, one hidden fully connected layer with 512 nodes and a final output layer utilizing softmax. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to implement the same network architecture found in the Keras documentation and apply it using PyTorch."
